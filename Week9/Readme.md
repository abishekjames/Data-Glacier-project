## Deliverables

* Data cleansing and transformation done on the data.

* Try at least 2 techniques to clean the data ( for NA values : mean/median/mode/Model based approach to handle NA value/WOE and like this try different techniques to identify and handle outliers as well)

* Each member should code and review peers work. (Review comment should be present in the github repo)

* Each team member should work on different data cleansing approach.
